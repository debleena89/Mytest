consChecker is a program for consistency checking of a given set of C assertions. The tool 
consists of a parser front end which reads in an assertion file containing variable declarations 
and assertions, generates an equivalent Yices files and passes on the file to Yices for 
checking of consistency. 

The installation instructions and usage guidelines follow.

Dependencies:
------------
a) tc-shell for running the scripts
b) make for compiling
c) Flex and Bison for the parsers
d) gcc compiler
e) Yices

Installation:
------------

Create a directory at a suitable place for installation. Let us suppose we name the 
directory ISIConsChecker inside our home directory. The following are the steps:

A) cd -- takes you directly to your home directory
B) mkdir ISIConsChecker

Move the compressed file consChecker.tar.gz inside $HOME/ISIConsChecker

C) chdir  $HOME/ISIConsChecker -- Move into $HOME/ISIConsChecker and start installation

D) Install consChecker
	-- tar xvzf consChecker.tar.gz
	-- chdir consChecker

Running consChecker
-------------------

1) Change the executable permission of yices 
   chmod +x yices

2) Go inside the run directory: cd run

3) Change the executable permission of runScript
   chmod +x runScript

4) ./runScript <TestFileName>
   Example: ./runScript ../Test/inFile4

This produces a file called t.ys inside the current directory and passes it on to Yices 
for checking.

Finally, we display if the given set of assertins are consistency or inconsistent.

Test directory
--------------

The test directory contains test-cases to test consChecker on different examples.
